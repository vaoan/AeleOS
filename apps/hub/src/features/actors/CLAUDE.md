# The actors feature — how an actor is addressed

This note constrains code that **does not exist yet**. Everything already
built states its own contract in TSDoc, where `pnpm check:docs` keeps it
honest; what follows is the addressing model the next migration and the public
page must implement, and the traps that model creates.

The schema itself is owned by `supabase/migrations/` at the repository root,
not by this app. Nothing here ships a migration. That schema was consolidated on
2026-08-13 into ten files with **every object defined exactly once**; the
migrations this note calls for are `0011` onward, and they must keep that
property.

## Why this feature holds both persons and fursonas

A person actor and a fursona actor are rows in the same `actors` table under
one ownership ledger, so splitting them would put `actor_ref` in two features'
domains and force the cross-feature import the boundary rules forbid. The
barrel is the only way in.

## Two public pages, not one

```
me.furrycolombia.com/{person_address}            the person's profile
me.furrycolombia.com/{person_address}/{handle}   one of their fursonas
```

Both are locale-prefixed in the usual way (`/es/42`, `/es/42/luna`). The first
segment is a **person address**, which may be a number or text — see below.
Both forms of address resolve to the same profile.

Routes: `app/[locale]/[person]/page.tsx` and
`app/[locale]/[person]/[handle]/page.tsx`.

**A person's profile carries the same shape as a fursona's** — display name,
avatar, and sections — and additionally lists the fursonas they own. One
renderer serves both; the person page passes a list where the fursona page
passes none.

Two consequences for the schema, both of which must land with the first
migration rather than after it:

- **Sections stopped belonging to fursonas** (shipped 2026-08-13).
  `actor_profiles` holds them, and `owns_active_actor()` is the ownership test —
  a person's own row, or a fursona they own. `owns_active_fursona()` survives
  for ARRANGEMENT only: `sort_order` and `featured` are about a person's set of
  fursonas, and there is exactly one person row to order. The write is
  `set_actor_sections`.
- **A person actor becomes publicly readable**, subject to the same
  `visibility` and `status` rules as any other actor. It defaults to `private`,
  so a profile page is **opt-in**: until somebody publishes it, the bare address
  404s while their public fursonas keep working. That is coherent, not a bug.

**There is no reserved-word list, and that is deliberate.** Addresses are
assigned only by an admin, so nobody can squat `admin` or `furrycolombia`; a
list guarding against that would be protecting against ourselves.

What does still hold is a routing fact, not a policy. Next matches a static
segment before a dynamic one, so a few strings **cannot resolve as an address
at all**:

`me` · `picker` · `fursonas` · `sign-in` · `api` · `trpc` · every value in
`routing.locales`

Assign one of those and the profile is simply unreachable — `/fursonas` is the
signed-in list, so a stranger looking for that person gets bounced to sign-in
instead. Not dangerous, but confusing to diagnose, because nothing errors.

This is written down rather than enforced. If it ever bites, the fix is a check
constraint deriving the locales from `routing.locales` rather than repeating
them; until then, whoever assigns a vanity just needs to have read this.

An earlier draft of this used `/@handle`. It is superseded. If you are reading
a document that still says `@`, this note is newer. (Note for whoever revives
the idea: a directory literally named `@[handle]` would not work anyway —
`@folder` is Next's parallel-routes convention and such a segment contributes
nothing to the URL. Confirmed in `node_modules/next/dist/docs`.)

## The locale prefix stays, and not for the reason it looks like

Every address is locale-prefixed — `/es/42/luna`, `/en/42/luna` — because
`routing.ts` leaves `localePrefix` at next-intl's default of `always`.

**Do not enshrine the wrong reason for this.** What SEO needs is a _distinct URL
per language_; one URL serving two languages is what costs you. next-intl's
`as-needed` would satisfy that just as well — `/42/luna` for Spanish, the
default, and `/en/42/luna` for English — with `hreflang` working normally and
both indexing fine. Only `never` would actually hurt.

So the prefix is kept for **uniformity**, not for search: every URL has the same
shape, `public-routes.ts` keeps its simple `/${locale}/…` construction, and the
end-to-end suite does not churn. That is a modest, real gain, and it is the
whole of the argument.

Decided 2026-08-13, knowing the alternative was free. If the `/es` ever becomes
worth removing, `as-needed` is available and costs no traffic — reopen it on
those terms rather than believing SEO forbids it.

## Person addresses: the number, and the vanity

A person has **one permanent number** and **optionally a vanity**, and **both
resolve to the same profile, forever.**

- **The number** is sequential and assigned at provisioning. It is never
  replaced, never reused, and never stops working. #7 is genuinely the seventh
  person here, which is exactly what makes it worth awarding — a random value
  would carry no such meaning.
- **The vanity** is granted by an admin and may be **text or a different
  number**. It does not remove the number; it is an additional way in.

### They share one namespace, and that is the whole design

**A vanity may be a number, so two separate unique columns are wrong.** Person
#500 could take the vanity `7` while person #7 already exists, and `/7/luna`
would then address two different people. One unique index over one namespace is
the only thing that prevents this; two unique constraints look correct and are
not.

So addresses belong in **their own relation**, one row per address, with a
single `unique (lower(address))` covering both forms:

| column      | meaning                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`   | the URL segment. Unique across every person, case-insensitively. |
| `actor_ref` | the person it resolves to.                                       |
| `kind`      | `number` or `vanity`.                                            |

### Format

**Confirmed 2026-08-13.** An address matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$` and is
unique case-insensitively — the same grammar a fursona handle already follows,
so nobody has to learn two. A number satisfies it as its decimal digits.

A person's `number` row is written at provisioning and **must never be deleted
or updated**. A `vanity` row is added later. If a vanity is ever revoked its row
is removed and the number keeps working — which is why the number must never
be the thing that moves.

Prefer the vanity when rendering a link, and emit `rel="canonical"` to it, so
one page does not accumulate two indexed addresses. Both must keep resolving:
links already shared under the number cannot be allowed to rot.

### Three rules, each of which destroys the feature if broken

- **Only `service_role` writes an address.** A person who can choose their own
  number or vanity makes every badge worthless within a day, and lets somebody
  claim a reserved word or another person's number. There is no self-service
  write here and there must not be one.
- **No address is ever reused for a different person.** It is somebody's
  identity in the community, and recycling it onto a stranger is the same
  mistake as freeing a handle — see soft delete's reasoning in the studio port
  spec.
- **An address never replaces `actor_ref` anywhere.** `actor_ref` remains the
  key every consuming app stores and every RLS policy resolves. An address is a
  URL segment and a display value, nothing more. A route that looks one up must
  resolve it to `actor_ref` before it authorizes anything.

## Fursona handles are unique per owner, not globally

**Confirmed 2026-08-13.** `/42/luna` and `/57/luna` are two different characters
and both are valid.

**Shipped 2026-08-13.** `0001_actors.sql` carries `actors_person_handle_idx`
and `actors_fursona_handle_idx`; the single `actors_handle_lower_idx` it
replaced is gone.

**Two partial unique indexes, not one composite.** A person has
`owner_ref is null`, and Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in a unique index by
default, so `unique (owner_ref, lower(handle))` would silently let two people
share a person handle. Postgres 17 offers `nulls not distinct`, but the partial
pair states the intent instead of relying on a modifier somebody has to notice:

```sql
unique (lower(handle))             where kind = 'person'
unique (owner_ref, lower(handle))  where kind = 'fursona'
```

Person handles therefore stay globally unique — they are the opaque
`u-<actor_ref>` form and nobody competes for them.

Four consequences, all of which landed with it:

- **`create_fursona`'s conflict test** is per-owner, and it raises
  `handle already yours` rather than `handle already taken` — the only clash a
  caller can hit is their own, so the old wording would have told them something
  about a stranger's account that is not true.
- **The quota's justification changed and the quota stayed.** Handle scarcity
  is no longer a reason; sanction evasion and an unbounded client-reachable
  write on a free-tier database are. Soft delete's rationale narrowed the same
  way — a freed handle now returns only to its own owner — so what survives
  there is the quota and the fact that a handle is part of a public address.
- **`docs/integrating.md` must say handles are unique per person only** — still
  outstanding. The
  contract already tells apps to key off `actor_ref` and never the handle, so it
  holds — but an app that quietly used `handle` as a key would begin colliding
  across users, silently, in a different repository. Say it there rather than
  trusting the existing sentence to be read that way.
- **`/api/actors/mine` keeps returning `handle`** and keeps _not_ returning
  `identity_sub` or `owner_ref`. Nothing about this change relaxes that: the
  linkability columns are picked out by name, and a per-owner handle is not a
  reason to start sending one.

## The listing rule — the one most likely to be got wrong

A person's profile lists **only their `public` fursonas**. Never `unlisted`,
never `private`, never suspended or deleted.

The obvious implementation is "list the fursonas they own", and it silently
destroys the entire meaning of `unlisted`: a link somebody chose not to publish
would appear on a page anybody can read. Write the filter first and the query
second.

This is also what makes `unlisted` genuinely useful rather than a half-step
between the other two, and the distinction is worth stating to a person in
those terms:

| visibility | own page     | listed on the profile | indexable |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| `public`   | yes          | **yes**               | yes       |
| `unlisted` | yes, by link | **no**                | no        |
| `private`  | no           | no                    | no        |

So somebody who wants a shareable character that is **not** visibly one of
theirs uses `unlisted`. Publishing a fursona as `public` is the act of
associating it with the rest — which is a choice they make per character, and
the reason no separate "show on my profile" toggle is needed or wanted.

## What publishing under a number does and does not reveal

Two fursonas at `/42/` are **provably the same account**. That is intended: it
is what makes a community number worth having.

Know the limit. The person's `identity_sub`, `owner_ref`, email and account are
still never exposed — this is pseudonymous linkage, not identification. But it
is real linkage, and it bites hardest on an **unlisted** fursona: the moment
its link is shared, the recipient can associate it with every other character
under the same number.

So `unlisted` protects the address, not the association. A character that must
be genuinely unlinkable stays `private`. Do not describe `unlisted` to a user
as if it hid the connection.

## Things not to do

- **Never put the owner's handle or `actor_ref` in a URL.** The number exists
  precisely so neither has to be. Publishing `owner_ref` in an address bar
  would leak, permanently and to everybody, the exact column
  `/api/actors/mine` strips by name.
- **Never free a handle**, on delete or on rename. A retired character's name
  becoming available lets somebody register it to impersonate the character
  that wore it. Delete is soft for this reason; any rename feature must retire
  the old handle to the same fursona rather than releasing it.
- **Never list a fursona a stranger could not otherwise find.** See the listing
  rule above; it is the single easiest thing here to get wrong, because the
  wrong version reads perfectly naturally.
- **Never make a hidden actor distinguishable from a missing one.** Private,
  suspended, deleted, owner-suspended and never-existed all answer 404, and the
  404 names nothing — no handle, no display name, no "this is private". A
  distinguishable response is an existence oracle on a page with no session and
  no rate limit in front of it.
- **Never let a public page outlive its owner's suspension**, the person's own
  profile included. A person
  carries the sanction and must not shed it by switching persona; a page that
  ignores the owner's status sheds it in the one place strangers look.
