# The actors feature — how an actor is addressed

This note constrains code that **does not exist yet**. Everything already
built states its own contract in TSDoc, where `pnpm check:docs` keeps it
honest; what follows is the addressing model the next migration and the public
page must implement, and the traps that model creates.

The schema itself is owned by `supabase/migrations/` at the repository root,
not by this app. Nothing here ships a migration. That schema is consolidated — **every object is defined exactly once** — and
squashed again whenever a change would otherwise stack a redefinition on top of
an existing file. The section layouts landed as an edit to `0009`, not as an
`0017`. See the root `CLAUDE.md` for when that is legitimate and what a squash
obliges you to update afterwards.

## Why this feature holds both persons and fursonas

A person actor and a fursona actor are rows in the same `actors` table under
one ownership ledger, so splitting them would put `actor_ref` in two features'
domains and force the cross-feature import the boundary rules forbid. The
barrel is the only way in.

## Two public pages, not one

```
me.furrycolombia.com/{person_address}            the person's profile
me.furrycolombia.com/{person_address}/{handle}   one of their fursonas
```

Both are locale-prefixed in the usual way (`/es/42`, `/es/42/luna`). The first
segment is a **person address**, which may be a number or text — see below.
Both forms of address resolve to the same profile.

Routes: `app/[locale]/[person]/page.tsx` and
`app/[locale]/[person]/[handle]/page.tsx`.

**A person's profile carries the same shape as a fursona's** — display name,
avatar, and sections — and additionally lists the fursonas they own. One
renderer serves both; the person page passes a list where the fursona page
passes none.

Two consequences for the schema, both of which must land with the first
migration rather than after it:

- **Sections stopped belonging to fursonas** (shipped 2026-08-13).
  `actor_profiles` holds them, and `owns_active_actor()` is the ownership test —
  a person's own row, or a fursona they own. `owns_active_fursona()` survives
  for ARRANGEMENT only: `sort_order` and `featured` are about a person's set of
  fursonas, and there is exactly one person row to order. The write is
  `set_actor_sections`.
- **A person actor becomes publicly readable**, subject to the same
  `visibility` and `status` rules as any other actor. It defaults to `private`,
  so a profile page is **opt-in**: until somebody publishes it, the bare address
  404s while their public fursonas keep working. That is coherent, not a bug.

**There is no reserved-word list, and that is deliberate.** Addresses are
assigned only by an admin, so nobody can squat `admin` or `furrycolombia`; a
list guarding against that would be protecting against ourselves.

What does still hold is a routing fact, not a policy. Next matches a static
segment before a dynamic one, so a few strings **cannot resolve as an address
at all**:

`me` · `picker` · `fursonas` · `sign-in` · `api` · `trpc` · every value in
`routing.locales`

Assign one of those and the profile is simply unreachable — `/fursonas` is the
signed-in list, so a stranger looking for that person gets bounced to sign-in
instead. Not dangerous, but confusing to diagnose, because nothing errors.

This is written down rather than enforced. If it ever bites, the fix is a check
constraint deriving the locales from `routing.locales` rather than repeating
them; until then, whoever assigns a vanity just needs to have read this.

An earlier draft of this used `/@handle`. It is superseded. If you are reading
a document that still says `@`, this note is newer. (Note for whoever revives
the idea: a directory literally named `@[handle]` would not work anyway —
`@folder` is Next's parallel-routes convention and such a segment contributes
nothing to the URL. Confirmed in `node_modules/next/dist/docs`.)

## The locale prefix stays, and not for the reason it looks like

Every address is locale-prefixed — `/es/42/luna`, `/en/42/luna` — because
`routing.ts` leaves `localePrefix` at next-intl's default of `always`.

**Do not enshrine the wrong reason for this.** What SEO needs is a _distinct URL
per language_; one URL serving two languages is what costs you. next-intl's
`as-needed` would satisfy that just as well — `/42/luna` for Spanish, the
default, and `/en/42/luna` for English — with `hreflang` working normally and
both indexing fine. Only `never` would actually hurt.

So the prefix is kept for **uniformity**, not for search: every URL has the same
shape, `public-routes.ts` keeps its simple `/${locale}/…` construction, and the
end-to-end suite does not churn. That is a modest, real gain, and it is the
whole of the argument.

Decided 2026-08-13, knowing the alternative was free. If the `/es` ever becomes
worth removing, `as-needed` is available and costs no traffic — reopen it on
those terms rather than believing SEO forbids it.

## Person addresses: the number, and the vanity

A person has **one permanent number** and **optionally a vanity**, and **both
resolve to the same profile, forever.**

- **The number** is sequential and assigned at provisioning. It is never
  replaced, never reused, and never stops working. #7 is genuinely the seventh
  person here, which is exactly what makes it worth awarding — a random value
  would carry no such meaning.
- **The vanity** is granted by an admin and may be **text or a different
  number**. It does not remove the number; it is an additional way in.

### They share one namespace, and that is the whole design

**A vanity may be a number, so two separate unique columns are wrong.** Person
#500 could take the vanity `7` while person #7 already exists, and `/7/luna`
would then address two different people. One unique index over one namespace is
the only thing that prevents this; two unique constraints look correct and are
not.

So addresses belong in **their own relation**, one row per address, with a
single `unique (lower(address))` covering both forms:

| column      | meaning                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`   | the URL segment. Unique across every person, case-insensitively. |
| `actor_ref` | the person it resolves to.                                       |
| `kind`      | `number` or `vanity`.                                            |

### Format

**Confirmed 2026-08-13.** An address matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$` and is
unique case-insensitively — the same grammar a fursona handle already follows,
so nobody has to learn two. A number satisfies it as its decimal digits.

A person's `number` row is written at provisioning and **must never be deleted
or updated**. A `vanity` row is added later. If a vanity is ever revoked its row
is removed and the number keeps working — which is why the number must never
be the thing that moves.

Prefer the vanity when rendering a link, and emit `rel="canonical"` to it, so
one page does not accumulate two indexed addresses. Both must keep resolving:
links already shared under the number cannot be allowed to rot.

### Three rules, each of which destroys the feature if broken

- **Only `service_role` writes an address.** A person who can choose their own
  number or vanity makes every badge worthless within a day, and lets somebody
  claim a reserved word or another person's number. There is no self-service
  write here and there must not be one.
- **No address is ever reused for a different person.** It is somebody's
  identity in the community, and recycling it onto a stranger is the same
  mistake as freeing a handle — see soft delete's reasoning in the studio port
  spec.
- **An address never replaces `actor_ref` anywhere.** `actor_ref` remains the
  key every consuming app stores and every RLS policy resolves. An address is a
  URL segment and a display value, nothing more. A route that looks one up must
  resolve it to `actor_ref` before it authorizes anything.

## Fursona handles are unique per owner, not globally

**Confirmed 2026-08-13.** `/42/luna` and `/57/luna` are two different characters
and both are valid.

**Shipped 2026-08-13.** `0001_actors.sql` carries `actors_person_handle_idx`
and `actors_fursona_handle_idx`; the single `actors_handle_lower_idx` it
replaced is gone.

**Two partial unique indexes, not one composite.** A person has
`owner_ref is null`, and Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in a unique index by
default, so `unique (owner_ref, lower(handle))` would silently let two people
share a person handle. Postgres 17 offers `nulls not distinct`, but the partial
pair states the intent instead of relying on a modifier somebody has to notice:

```sql
unique (lower(handle))             where kind = 'person'
unique (owner_ref, lower(handle))  where kind = 'fursona'
```

Person handles therefore stay globally unique — they are the opaque
`u-<actor_ref>` form and nobody competes for them.

Four consequences, all of which landed with it:

- **`create_fursona`'s conflict test** is per-owner, and it raises
  `handle already yours` rather than `handle already taken` — the only clash a
  caller can hit is their own, so the old wording would have told them something
  about a stranger's account that is not true.
- **The quota's justification changed and the quota stayed.** Handle scarcity
  is no longer a reason; sanction evasion and an unbounded client-reachable
  write on a free-tier database are. Soft delete's rationale narrowed the same
  way — a freed handle now returns only to its own owner — so what survives
  there is the quota and the fact that a handle is part of a public address.
- **`docs/integrating.md` must say handles are unique per person only** — still
  outstanding. The
  contract already tells apps to key off `actor_ref` and never the handle, so it
  holds — but an app that quietly used `handle` as a key would begin colliding
  across users, silently, in a different repository. Say it there rather than
  trusting the existing sentence to be read that way.
- **`/api/actors/mine` keeps returning `handle`** and keeps _not_ returning
  `identity_sub` or `owner_ref`. Nothing about this change relaxes that: the
  linkability columns are picked out by name, and a per-owner handle is not a
  reason to start sending one.

## The listing rule — the one most likely to be got wrong

A person's profile lists **only their `public` fursonas**. Never `unlisted`,
never `private`, never suspended or deleted.

The obvious implementation is "list the fursonas they own", and it silently
destroys the entire meaning of `unlisted`: a link somebody chose not to publish
would appear on a page anybody can read. Write the filter first and the query
second.

This is also what makes `unlisted` genuinely useful rather than a half-step
between the other two, and the distinction is worth stating to a person in
those terms:

| visibility | own page     | listed on the profile | indexable |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| `public`   | yes          | **yes**               | yes       |
| `unlisted` | yes, by link | **no**                | no        |
| `private`  | no           | no                    | no        |

So somebody who wants a shareable character that is **not** visibly one of
theirs uses `unlisted`. Publishing a fursona as `public` is the act of
associating it with the rest — which is a choice they make per character, and
the reason no separate "show on my profile" toggle is needed or wanted.

## What publishing under a number does and does not reveal

Two fursonas at `/42/` are **provably the same account**. That is intended: it
is what makes a community number worth having.

Know the limit. The person's `identity_sub`, `owner_ref`, email and account are
still never exposed — this is pseudonymous linkage, not identification. But it
is real linkage, and it bites hardest on an **unlisted** fursona: the moment
its link is shared, the recipient can associate it with every other character
under the same number.

So `unlisted` protects the address, not the association. A character that must
be genuinely unlinkable stays `private`. Do not describe `unlisted` to a user
as if it hid the connection.

## The layouts, and what the two text fields mean in each

A page is sections, a section has a layout, and a layout decides what its items
look like. There are eleven. The first four came from Libra; the rest exist
because **a fursona page is somebody's character, not a product listing** — the
layouts that serve a catalogue do not stretch to a page whose whole job is to
be theirs. More are wanted; this list is a floor, not a ceiling.

| layout       | what an item is      | `title`         | `description`     | uses               |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `cards`      | a card               | heading         | body              | `icon`             |
| `accordion`  | a disclosure         | summary         | the answer        | —                  |
| `two-column` | a row of a table     | label           | value             | —                  |
| `gallery`    | a picture            | alt text        | caption           | `image_url`        |
| `carousel`   | a picture on one row | alt text        | caption           | `image_url`        |
| `video`      | an embedded player   | frame title     | caption           | `link_url`         |
| `music`      | an embedded player   | track name      | note              | `link_url`         |
| `links`      | a button out         | button text     | subtitle          | `link_url`, `icon` |
| `stats`      | one fact             | **the label**   | **the value**     | —                  |
| `quote`      | a quotation          | **who said it** | **what was said** | —                  |
| `timeline`   | an entry in order    | heading         | the story         | —                  |

**`stats` and `quote` invert the pair**, and that is the one thing here somebody
will get wrong. Everywhere else the title is the big text; in those two the
description is. The editor names its fields per layout for this reason — a
field whose meaning changes silently between layouts is worse than a field that
does not exist.

**Adding a layout is four edits and a guard will catch you missing one.**
`SECTION_TYPES`, `is_section_type()` in `0009`, a renderer in the `LAYOUTS`
record, and a name in both catalogues. The record is typed
`Record<SectionType, …>` so the compiler refuses a missing renderer, and
`section-limits-match-migration.test.ts` reads the SQL and fails when the two
lists disagree. Nothing checks that a layout is _good_; that part is still on
you.

**A layout that renders no field must not offer it.** `LINKED`, `ICONED` and
`PICTURED` in `section-item-fields.tsx` decide what the editor shows. A control
that accepts what somebody types, stores it, refuses nothing and renders
nothing is the worst kind — there is no way for them to learn it did nothing.

### Embedded media is allowlist-and-rebuild, never pass-through

`domain/embeds.ts` is the whole security model of the media layouts and its
TSDoc carries the argument in full. The short version, because it must not be
weakened by somebody who only read this file:

**What somebody pasted never reaches the page.** Every branch parses the
address, checks the host against an exact set on the parsed `hostname`,
extracts an id matching a strict pattern, and then BUILDS a new address from a
fixed template. A hostile value cannot become anything worse than no embed.

- Only `https:` survives, so `javascript:` and `data:` cannot reach a frame and
  run in this page's origin.
- Hosts are never matched by prefix or suffix. `youtube.com.evil.example`,
  `evil-youtube.com` and `https://www.youtube.com@evil.example` all fail — the
  last one only because the comparison is on the parsed authority. This is the
  same mistake `return_to` had to avoid in the picker, and it is the same fix.
- Every query parameter is discarded. Carrying them would let whoever pasted
  the link set whatever options the provider honours.
- SoundCloud's widget takes an address as a parameter — the one URL-inside-a-URL
  here. It is rebuilt from parsed path segments and then encoded, so a `&` in
  what somebody pasted cannot add parameters to the widget.
- Anchors go through `safeHttpUrl` and an address that fails renders as plain
  text. React escapes text, not URL schemes; nothing upstream is catching this.
- Public links carry `nofollow ugc` as well as `noopener noreferrer`. A page
  anybody can publish links on has to say so, or it becomes a way to buy
  ranking.
- **No frame is granted `autoplay`.** A profile that starts making noise at
  whoever opened it is the thing people remember most fondly and least
  accurately about the pages this borrows from.

**There is a second layer now.** `shared/domain/csp.ts` sets a
Content-Security-Policy on every route whose `frame-src` is built from
`PLAYER_ORIGINS` — so a frame can only ever point at a player this app can
produce, even if the resolver were made to build something else. The two lists
are pinned to each other by tests on both sides.

Read that file before editing the policy. Two things about it are easy to get
wrong and both fail quietly:

- **Cloudflare Turnstile must stay in `frame-src`.** Clerk frames it for bot
  protection, and without it the sign-in form renders with an empty box where
  the challenge should be.
- **`script-src` carries `'unsafe-inline'`**, because Next inlines its own
  bootstrap. So the policy is **not** a defence against injected inline script,
  and it must not be described as though it were. The parts that protect
  something are `frame-src`, `object-src`, `base-uri`, `form-action` and
  `frame-ancestors`, none of which depend on `script-src`. A nonce is the
  upgrade, and its cost is that every page renders dynamically.

## Per-profile theming — built

Somebody themes their own page from a panel in the editor, and a stranger sees
it as they built it. What the code decided, and why, so it is not undone:

- **The pickers are unconstrained, so the measurement moved into the code
  path.** A curated palette is not personalisation. `legibleAccent` in
  `shared/domain/color.ts` keeps the hue and chroma somebody picked and
  **solves for the lightness** against the mode's surface — their colour, only
  moved as far as it must be. A colour already legible is returned untouched.
- **Both constraints drive that search.** An accent can clear 4.5:1 against the
  surface while neither near-white nor near-black clears 4.5:1 against the
  accent; a mid-lightness colour sits exactly in that gap. Solving only the
  first ships a readable page with an unreadable button on it. A failing test
  found this — do not simplify it back.
- **The maths agrees with `check-contrast.mjs` and a test asserts it.** Two
  implementations of one formula is a drift risk; if they part ways, one of
  them is lying about legibility.
- **A theme is a set of OVERRIDES. `null` means the design's own.**
  `globals.css` uses different accent HUES for light and dark deliberately, so
  no single stored colour reproduces both — a theme that always emitted an
  accent would restyle every unthemed page in one of the two modes. An
  unparseable value emits nothing too: black was the obvious fallback and it
  invents a decision nobody made.
- **The visitor's scheme stays the visitor's.** `ThemeScope` emits a `<style>`
  carrying BOTH renderings, with the same three selectors `globals.css` uses,
  because the server cannot know the reader's mode. A rule defined only inside
  the media query leaves somebody who chose dark on a light-preferring system
  with the light accent. Only the accent pair and the cloud tints are set.
- **Values are generated from numbers, never from stored strings.** That is
  what makes emitting a stylesheet safe. A stored value passed through would let
  a `}` close the rule and everything after it would be CSS somebody else wrote.
- **Live preview, not live persistence.** The preview uses the SAME `themeCss`
  the public page uses, so the two cannot drift. The write rides the ordinary
  save: what has to be instant is SEEING a colour, and a write per frame of a
  dragged slider is a different thing.
- **The adjustment is disclosed by two swatches, not a warning.** An `adjusted`
  flag was tried and is incoherent — a colour cannot be both too light for a
  light page and too dark for a dark one, so it was false for nearly every
  input.

### Canvases

`CANVASES` holds **exactly the canvases that exist** — today the nebula, a
starfield, an aurora, and stillness. It briefly listed two
more, named for animations nobody had written, and that is the worst kind of
control: it offers a choice, accepts it, stores it, and changes nothing, with no
way for the person to learn that it did nothing. **A canvas joins that list in
the same change that implements it.**

**The backdrop travels at `:root` scope and the accent does not**, and getting
this wrong once already shipped: the canvas is a fixed, full-viewport element
mounted in the root layout, and it reads its colours from
`document.documentElement`. Scoping its inputs to the page's content element
meant it never saw them — an author could pick two backdrop colours, and they
were stored, emitted, and read by nothing at all. The chosen canvas travels the
same way, as `--canvas`, because a client component mounted at the document
root cannot be handed a prop by a page nested inside it.

Nothing in that root scope varies by mode. An author picks two colours and those
are the colours in both schemes; what adapts is `--nebula-blend`, which stays in
`globals.css` — `screen` in dark because dust emits light, `multiply` in light
because it absorbs it. Same two colours, opposite physics.

Every canvas reads `--nebula-a` and `--nebula-b`, so **an author's two colours
travel to whichever canvas they pick** rather than each animation inventing its
own palette. A new canvas that hard-codes colours is wrong. They must also
respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and stay off wherever the star toggle says off
— that toggle is the visitor's control over their own machine and the author's
choice may not overrule it.

## Things not to do

- **Never put the owner's handle or `actor_ref` in a URL.** The number exists
  precisely so neither has to be. Publishing `owner_ref` in an address bar
  would leak, permanently and to everybody, the exact column
  `/api/actors/mine` strips by name.
- **Never free a handle**, on delete or on rename. A retired character's name
  becoming available lets somebody register it to impersonate the character
  that wore it. Delete is soft for this reason; any rename feature must retire
  the old handle to the same fursona rather than releasing it.
- **Never list a fursona a stranger could not otherwise find.** See the listing
  rule above; it is the single easiest thing here to get wrong, because the
  wrong version reads perfectly naturally.
- **Never make a hidden actor distinguishable from a missing one.** Private,
  suspended, deleted, owner-suspended and never-existed all answer 404, and the
  404 names nothing — no handle, no display name, no "this is private". A
  distinguishable response is an existence oracle on a page with no session and
  no rate limit in front of it.
- **Never let a public page outlive its owner's suspension**, the person's own
  profile included. A person
  carries the sanction and must not shed it by switching persona; a page that
  ignores the owner's status sheds it in the one place strangers look.
