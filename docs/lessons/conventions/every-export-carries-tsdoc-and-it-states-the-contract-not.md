# Every export carries TSDoc, and it states the contract — not the types.

- **Every export carries TSDoc, and it states the contract — not the types.**
  TypeScript already has the types; repeating them is drift waiting to happen.
  Say what a caller may assume, what throws, what is idempotent, what is
  security-relevant. `pnpm lint` fails without it, and fails again if a
  parameter is renamed without its `@param`.
